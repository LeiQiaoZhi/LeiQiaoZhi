One of my favorite hobbies is game development, and I absolutely enjoy taking part in thrilling game jams! Below, you can find the source code of some projects that I am particularly proud of:

0. I developed on a **[2D puzzle game](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/NumberSliderGame)** related to numbers and maths. It had been in development for 2-3 months.
1. **[Neon Dash](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/NeonDash)**: 2D arcade/action game in Unity, Ranked 4 overall, Mini Game Jam 128.
2. **[Mayi Garden](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/MAYIGarden)**: 2D base defence game in Unity, Winner of best use of theme, Cambridge Game Jam 2023.
3. **Cascade Down**: 3D platformer game in Unity, Ranked 23 overall, Mini Game Jam 104.
4. Experimental Projects: [wave function collapse](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/WaveFunctionCollapseUnity/tree/master) in Unity.
5. Tools: A [Dialogue Manager&Visualization Tool](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/UnityDialogueSystem) in Unity.
